\section{Scope and Applications of the Project}

\subsection{Scope}
This project has a very wide scope since you can integrate any technology inside of it. For the sake of the final year project, we will integrate JavaScript web technologies with this tool at the moment.

A lot of people can benefit from this project. It can be used by different companies to reduce the amount of time they spend on doing configs. Freelancers can use this tool to deliver timely to their clients since it eliminates the grunt work of setting up everything.

The major problems that are linked with this project is time wastage and lack of productivity. This tool addresses both of them.
