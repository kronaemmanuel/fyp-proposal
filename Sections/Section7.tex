\section{Challenges and Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Libraries update pretty often, which can render the boilerplate code outdated. This effect is compounded since we want to support different combinations of libraries.
  \item Different developers might want to work on specific versions of libraries which may not have been tested by us to work correctly, hence breaking the boilerplate.
  \item Design patterns followed when integrating technologies can vary based on the needs of the project. Even though we would try to write our code by following best practices, it may not be ideal for all projects.
  \item Each new technology that we choose to support can increase the size and complexity of our project exponentially, which means it will become hard to maintain. Our team will have to prioritize which technologies really matter since each new technology/library added could mean hours of work which can discourage the addition of new technologies.
